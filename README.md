This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This Simple App Contains, following Factors:

1. API integration with Dio and Retrofit.
2. Getit for Registering the services.

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller and is a popular architecture pattern in Flutter development. The MVC pattern separates the app into three distinct parts:

## Model: The data and business logic of the app
## View: The user interface of the app
## Controller: The mediator between the model and the view
## Pros:

1. Easy to understand and implement
2. Provides a clear separation of concerns
3. Supports code reusability and maintainability

## Cons:
1. This can lead to tight coupling between the model and the view
2. Can become difficult to maintain for larger apps
3. This can result in redundant code
